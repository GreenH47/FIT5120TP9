    <h3 class="subtitle">Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Remove any labels and clean the plastic bottle thoroughly to remove any residue.</li><li>2. Remove the bottle cap and cut off the bottom of the bottle using a craft knife or scissors. This will be the top of your lantern.</li><li>3. Decide on a design for your lantern. You can sketch it lightly on the bottle with a marker if you'd like to have a guide.</li><li>4. Use the craft knife or scissors to carefully cut out the design from the plastic bottle. Common designs include stars, hearts, or simple geometric patterns. Be cautious while cutting and take your time to ensure smooth edges.</li><li>5. After cutting, you might notice some rough or sharp edges. You can use sandpaper to smooth these edges and make sure your lantern is safe to handle.</li><li>6. If you want to add color to your lantern, you can stick some color paper on the outside of the bottle. Let your creativity shine here! You can paint patterns and images or even just add a base color.</li><li>7. Near the top of the lantern (the part where you removed the bottle cap), punch two holes directly across from each other. You can use a hole punch or carefully heat a metal skewer over a flame and pierce the plastic.</li><li>8. Cut a piece of wire or string to your desired length for the handle. Thread it through the holes you created in the previous step and secure it with knots on the inside of the lantern.</li><li>9. Place a tea light candle or an LED tea light inside the lantern through the open bottom. If you're using a real candle, make sure it's secure and stable.</li><li>10. Light the candle or turn on the LED light to ensure your lantern creates a beautiful glow. Find a safe place to display your lantern, either hanging or on a flat surface.</li>
