  <h3 class="subtitle">Composting Food Waste</h3>
  <p>Composting food waste is an eco-friendly way to reduce landfill waste and create nutrient-rich soil. Simply collect your food scraps and garden waste in a compost bin, and let nature do the work to create compost that can be used in your own garden.</p>
